## Deepsig

---

Deepsig is a 2016-2018 [project](https://github.com/radioML) did by *[Timothy J. O'Shea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4S4GyXYAAAAJ&hl=en)* at Virginia Tech to do modulation classification by DL.

The purpose of this project is to replicate his work (some of the original functions are out-of-date due to change in python and tensorflow, e.g., python2 is no longer supported by the end of 2020) and learn ML on wireless.
